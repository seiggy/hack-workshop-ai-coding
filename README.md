# Scenario : Advanced AI Pair Programming Challenge

Developers today agree that AI code assistant tools are useful for easy, repeatable tasks. JSON to Class, quick templated code, writing simple scripts. But most still think it's bad at more complex tasks. This exercise is here to show you that assumption is no longer as true as you might think!

## Resources

In the [Exercise Files](./exercise-files/) folder, you'll find a series of Markdown files. These are just a few example requirements that we dreamed up to add new features to eShop. Choose one and see how well the AI framework implements the change!

## Goals

You'll understand better how to utilize advanced AI tools to increase your productivity and workflow.

1. **Setup the AI Coding Workflow**  
   The key to this workshop is our advanced workflow. This will show you how to reuse our work across your projects.
1. **Understanding Requirements**  
   We've created several sample requirements docs. Run one and see the results.
1. **Tips and Tricks**  
   Pitfalls to avoid, custom instructions, and prompt files

### Get Started!

- [.NET](./goals/dotnet/1-setup.md)
- [Java](./goals/java/1-setup.md)
- [Python](./goals/python/1-setup.md)
- [Typescript](./goals/typescript/1-setup.md)

## Validation

This workshop is designed to be a goal-oriented self-exploration of Advanced AI Coding using GitHub Copilot. Your results will vary, as AI development is non-deterministic.

## Where do we go from here?
