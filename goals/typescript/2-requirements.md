# ngLibrary Feature Development Challenge

## 🎯 Challenge Overview

Your mission is to **design and document a new feature** for the ngLibrary reference application. This challenge will teach you how to write comprehensive feature requirements that integrate seamlessly with the ConPort workflow and architectural patterns we've created.

## 📋 What You'll Learn

- How to analyze existing architecture before proposing new features
- Writing clear, actionable feature requirements
- Documenting technical decisions and trade-offs
- Creating implementation roadmaps that align with microservices patterns
- Using ConPort to track feature development progress

## 🏗️ Architecture Context

Before you begin, familiarize yourself with the existing ngLibrary architecture by reviewing:

- **Architecture Diagrams**: `architectureDiagrams/*.md` - Architecture documentation created by GitHub Copilot
- **Current Modules**: App, Books, Cart, Checkout, Layouts, Core
- **Technology Stack**: Typescript 4, Angular 11

## 🎲 Feature Ideas (Choose One or Create Your Own)

### 💡 **Beginner Level**

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Analyze the Architecture**: Spend time understanding the existing system
2. **Choose Your Feature**: Pick something that excites you and fits the domain
3. **Start with Why**: Begin with the business problem and user needs
4. **Design Incrementally**: Build complexity gradually
5. **Think Operations**: Consider monitoring, deployment, and maintenance
6. **Document Decisions**: Use ConPort to track your reasoning

## 💡 Pro Tips

### 🎯 **Requirements Writing**
- **Use Active Voice**: "The system shall..." not "The system should probably..."
- **Be Specific**: "Load in under 200ms" not "Load quickly"
- **Include Examples**: Show concrete scenarios
- **Consider Edge Cases**: What happens when things go wrong?

### 🏗️ **Architecture Decisions**
- **Follow Existing Patterns**: Don't reinvent what's working
- **Design for Failure**: What happens when dependencies fail?

## 🎉 Ready to Begin?

Remember: **Good requirements are the foundation of great software**. Take your time to think through the problem space before jumping into solutions. The ngLibrary application is a reference for modern software engineering practices—your feature should exemplify the same level of thoughtfulness and technical excellence.

**Start by creating your feature file and begin documenting your thinking process. Use Chat mode to help you if you're stuck!**

When you're created your requirements file, prompt Copilot in Agent Mode:

`Plan #feature-[your-feature-name].md`

This should trigger the planning process. The AI should validate and produce an implementation plan, and ask if you're ready to start! When you're ready to continue:

`Act: #feature-[your-feature-name].md`

From here, the AI will begin implementing your feature. Ensure you interact with the AI often, running unit tests, building and validating it's progress, provide feedback. Continue to use this process as you go until your feature is completed!
